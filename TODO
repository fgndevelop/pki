1) Do we need a directory structure that reflects the CA hierarchy ?
   Like when displaying certificates in a browser, where you see
   everything in a top-down manner from Root CA to End-User-Cert ?
   Or does this not make sense as any CA can sign any request (technically) ?

   Which is the ideal directory structure to work with the pki tool ?

2) Config files are not relocatable. So moving or renaming a CA directory
   fucks it all up. Workarounds ? Solutions ?

3) Extensions when signing certificates. Easy way to view extensions from
   the config file ? e.g. pki show -e <config file>
